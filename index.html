            <h2>Refactor before adding a feature</h2>
            <p>Much like a surgeon debrides a wound before closing it up, these
            refactorings also allow you to tidy your code up before adding a
            new feature.</p>

          <section>
            <h2>Are you ready to extract?</h2>
            <p>You're ready to refactor when you can answer these questions.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Is this logic used by other classes?</li>
              <li>Is it clear to me (at this point) where the boundaries of
                this logic end? (Can I create a good interface for it?)</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Are you ready to extract?</h2>

            <p>That "interface" question is important. It's cheaper to leave in
            repetition for a while than to create an incorrect abstraction,
            i.e. a bad interface.  It's also better to leave it if you're
            making your code less readable or searchable; other people have to
            work with it, after all.</p>

            <h2>Service Objects</h2>
            <p>You know you need a service object when:</p>

                model.</li>
              <li class="fragment">You’re talking to something that isn’t the current app. API
                calls should be wrapped in an object.</li>
              <li class="fragment">When the action you’re performing has multiple strategies,
                for example multiple authentication strategies as part of a
                user model.</li>

            <h2>Presenters, Decorators, and Composites</h2>

            <p>They're similar, and familiarly confusing.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Presenters</h2>

            <p>Presenters represent a strategy for dealing with the
            presentation logic for a model. Decorators and Composites are
            kinds of presenters.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Presentation logic in the model?</h2>

            <p>Whose responsibility is it?</p>
            <p>There's a space in-between models and views.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Presentation logic in the view?</h2>

            <p>Aren't views <em>for</em> presentation?</p>
            <p><code>number_to_currency()</code> everywhere</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Composites</h2>

            <p>Composites are <em>composed of</em> multiple components,
            usually models.</p>

            <p>Think of when you'd use view partials, e.g. an invoice with
            line items. That invoice might have a summary of total line
            items, with the total price and a tax calculation for each line
            item.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Decorators</h2>

            <p>Decorators allow objects to take on new responsibilities that are not "core".</p>
            <p>You can use decorators instead of subclassing.</p>
            <p>Use the <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/evaluating-alternative-decorator-implementations-in#the-quotplain-old-ruby-objectquot-poro-decorator">PORO decorator pattern</a>.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Presenters</h2>

            <p>Think of presenters as <strong>presentation service
            objects</strong>. This pattern allows you encapsulate complex
            presentation logic across serveral components without having to
            alter the innards of those components.</p>
