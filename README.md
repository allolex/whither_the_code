# Whither the code?

A presentation for the Broward Ruby Brigade.

“Thin controllers and fat models”—that was once the mantra. However, “fat” means 'lots of code' and “lots of code” means 'complexity'. At this meeting, we’re going to talk about how to thin down your classes and bring simplicity to your code base. We’ll talk about service objects, concerns, presenters, decorators and composites. Plus some other stuff.
